# A Lightweight FTP Client

This is a simple and lightweight FTP component with the following features:

- Simple & Lightweight: Easy to use and minimal in size.
- Based on JDK's `sun.*` extension package: Most standard JDK distributions already include built-in FTP capabilities. However, some environments (such as Android) do not support the `sun.*` packages â€” that's where this component comes in handy.
- Supports Progress Tracking: Adds the ability to monitor upload/download progress.
